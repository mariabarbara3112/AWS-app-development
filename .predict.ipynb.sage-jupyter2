This film oozes with mastery, every little detail tells a story of its own, I was drawn to it like a moth to a flame, it grips hard and it never lets go, it sways between genres gracefully, it offers comedy both dark and light, drama, horror, thrill, and it's all packaged so seamlessly, conveyed to us throughout breathtaking performances across the board, I've watched my share of Korean Cinema to know that's a common thing but Parasite takes it to a whole other level, it materializes thoughts and ideas, things words can not communicate, it is extremely rare to experience such a thing in film, I can only name a small number of movies that actually made me feel this way, just incredible. Director Bong Joon Ho proves that he is a master within his own cross-genre domain, he takes charge and you actually feel like you're in safe hands watching this, he shapes the scenes perfectly, A true master of his trade, Thank You. In all honesty, I feel like I went through an experiment where the time went still and I experienced a piece of art such as this, I absloutely, wholeheartedly loved every single second of this film, MINDBLOWING.\"\n\nwordvector = review_to_words(userInput)\nprint(userInput\ndef getCountmatrix(words, vocab):\n    bow = [0] * len(vocab) # Start by setting the count for each word in the vocabulary to zero.\n    for word in words.split():  # For each word in the string\n        if word in vocab:  # If the word is one that occurs in the vocabulary, increase its count.\n            matrix01[vocab[word]] += 1\n    return matrix\n\ncountMatrix = getCountmatrix(test_words, vocabulary)\nprint(countMatrix)\n\nlen(countMatrix)\n# To send the input to the endpoint it is necessary to start the endpoint back up.\nrtPredictor = xgb.deploy(initial_instance_count = 1, instance_type = 'ml.m4.xlarge') # rt := random tree\n      \nimport boto3\n\nruntime = boto3.Session().client('sagemaker-runtime')\nrtPredictor.endpoint\nresponseDict = runtime.invoke_endpoint(EndpointName = rtPredictor.endpoint, ContentType = 'text/csv', Body = test_bow)\n      \n      \nresponseDict = runtime.invoke_endpoint(EndpointName = rtPredictor.endpoint, ContentType = 'text/csv', Body = ','.join([str(d) for d in test_bow]).encode('utf-8'))\nprint(responseDict)\nresponse = responseDict['Body'].read().decode('utf-8')\nprint(response)\n      \nimport boto3\nimport re\n\nreplace = re.compile(\"(\\.)|(\\;)|(\\:)|(\\!)|(\\')|(\\?)|(\\,)|(\\\")|(\\()|(\\))|(\\[)|(\\])\")\nreplaceWithSpacing = re.compile(\"(<br\\s*/><br\\s*/>)|(\\-)|(\\/)\")\n\ndef convert2words(review):\n    words = replace.sub(\"\", review.lower())\n    words = replaceWithSpacing.sub(\" \", words)\n    return words\n\ndef getCountmatrix(words, vocab:\n    countmatrix = [0] * len(vocab) \n    for word in words.split():  \n        if word in vocab:  \n            countmatrix[vocab[word]] += 1\n    return countmatrix\n\ndef ldfunction(event, context):\n\n    vocab = \"Vocabulary:\"\n\n    words = convert2words(event['body'])\n    countmatrix = getCountmatrix(words, vocab)\n\n    # The SageMaker runtime is what allows us to invoke the endpoint\n    runtime = boto3.Session().client('sagemaker-runtime')\n\n    # use sm-runtime to invoke the endpoint / send the user input = review as .txt :\n    response = runtime.invoke_endpoint(EndpointName = rtPredictor.endpoint, ContentType = 'text/csv', Body = ','.join([str(val)                                        for val in bow]).encode('utf-8')) \n\n    # HTTP response whose body contains the result \n    result = response['Body'].read().decode('utf-8')\n\n    # Round the result so that the app gets just '1' or '0'\n    result = round(float(result))\n\n    return {\n        'statusCode' : 200,\n        'headers' : { 'Content-Type' : 'text/plain', 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' : '*' },\n        'body' : str(result)\n    }\n\nrtPredictor.endpoint\nprint(str(vocab))\nrtPredictor.delete_endpoint()","pos":0,"state":"done","type":"cell"}
